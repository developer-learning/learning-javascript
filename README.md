# Learning JavaScript

This project is created to explore the JavaScript Language. We hope that by participating in this project, all the contributors will gain a deeper understanding of JS and feel confident in daily developing work. The authors of these articles are by no means experts, but this fact doesn't necessarily reduce the legitimacy of the contents. On the contrary, we would argue that learning from the perspective of a learner can help you simulate the whole process of decomposing and understanding new concepts. This will not only help to consolidate your understanding, but also help you becoming a better learner.
