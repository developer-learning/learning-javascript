# Learning JavaScript

This project is created to help JS developers to gain better understanding of the JavaScript programming language and thus feel confident in daily developing work. The authors of these articles are by no means experts, but this fact doesn't necessarily reduce the legitimacy of the contents. On the contrary, I would argue that learning from the perspective of a learner can help you simulate the whole process of decompose and understand a new concept. This will not only help to consolidate your understanding, but also help you to become a better learner.
