# Learning JavaScript

This project is created to explore the JavaScript Language. We hope that by participating in this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript and eventually feel confident in your daily developing work. You don't need to be an expert to contribute to this project. On the contrary, we encourage beginners and intermediate level developers to contribute contents, as we believe that learning from the perspective of a learner can smooth the cognitive curve and thus be more accessible to readers from various backgrounds.

Advanced contents are also welcome. The JavaScript language is evolving fast. New language features keep being added in, new frameworks and libraries booming. Without a solid grasp of the core mechanism of the language, one can easily get discouraged. We encourage all participants to go deeper into various design patterns and programming paradigms, so that we can be more prepared for the changing trends, and avoid the famous symptom among developers called JavaScript fatigue. 😄
